Currently, only PNGs can be encoded- no JPEGs. This has to do with the "lossy" way that JPEGs are encoded! [Read more about lossy vs lossless encoding!](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/comparison/jpeg-vs-png.html)

## TODO:
- [x] Add cute cat pictures
- [ ] Create a "stop" string that the decoder can recognize
- [ ] Implement better error handling for incorrect inputs (I am too lazy to do this)
